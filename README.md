## About

Ballo is a mobile app that provides a "Ballo" creature for the user to interact with. Users will take care of their Ballos, tracking a Ballo's happiness through three stats: Hunger, Happiness, and Strength. The first two are capped at 100, while strength is uncapped. All of these stats will decay at a variable rate depending on the difficulty chosen by the user. If any one of these stats drops to zero, the Ballo will die, and the user must restart with a new Ballo with default stats.

### Hunger

Hunger decays with time, but also in relation to the Ballo being taken on walks. Though it may be counterintuitive, the more the Ballo's hunger bar is filled, the more satisfied the Ballo is. When the Ballo's hunger value drops below 50, the Ballo will be visibly saddened. The user can increase a Ballo's hunger bar simply by feeding it from the home screen.

### Happiness

Happiness drops the slowest of the three stats. If a Ballo's happiness drops below 50, he will be visibly saddened. The user can increase a Ballo's happiness by playing with it in Ballo Bounce, where the user shakes the phone to bounce the Ballo, with each bounce increasing the Ballo's happiness by some amount.

### Strength

Strength decays with time, but also in relation to the Ballo being played with in Ballo Bounce if the Ballo is at full happiness. The ecstatic Ballo will use up strength quickly when at peak happiness. When the Ballo's strength drops below 50, the Ballo will be visibly saddened. The user can increase a Ballo's strength by taking it on walks by leaving the app open while physically covering a distance. A Ballo's strength is also tracked through a universal leaderboard, allowing players to compare their best attempt at keeping a healthy Ballo alive and well.
